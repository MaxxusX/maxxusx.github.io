Crazy? I was crazy once.
you should kill yourself NOW!
Your life is nothing, you serve zero purpose, you should kill yourself NOW, and give somebody else a piece of that oxygen in the ozone layer that's covered up so we can breathe inside of this blue trapped bubble. Like what are you even here for? To worship me? Kill yourself. and I mean that with a hundred percent, with a thousand percent.

So please read. There is an app called Talking Angela. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT. There is a guy or guys behind it who stalk children. This one girl on twitter downloaded it and "Angela" asked where she lived but the girl lied and Angela replied "you lied" and then the girl's aunt's address came up on the screen. Then she tried to log off and Angela said "I know you're about to log off, watch out beautiful." The app also takes pictures of you with your front camera. This guy is like a genius. Please don't download it and warn people. It's so scary.
Greetings! Quandale Dingle here.

Stop posting about BALLER. I’m tired of seeing it! My friends on TikTok send me BALLER. On discord it’s fucking BALLER. I was on studio origami right? And all of the channels, were just BALLER. I showed my super scuffle art to my girlfriend (bitch you ain’t got no damn girlfriend 😂 stop the CAP‼️🧢) I said his name when the BALLER is BALLER.

My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a "hit" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in "Blood Money."] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.
Hello and, again, welcome to the Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment center.
To ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, do not destroy vital testing apparatus.
Well, you found me. Congratulations. Was it worth it?
I'll set your Parent property to nil. I'll call Destroy() on your ass. You must weigh a singleton, because you're nothing but Debris to me. Your family better connect to your Died() event, because I'll set your Health to 0. You better BindToClose(), because I'm about to shut you down. No need to set BreakJointsOnDeath, I'll just call BreakJoints() directly. We better update your Transparency, because you're about to become a ghost. Your Ancestry is about to change, kiddo. You're no longer gonna be a Descendant of this DataModel when I'm through with you. And don't think you'll be coming back, because I'm setting your RespawnLocation to nil. You're gonna be FallingDown, but you won't be GettingUp, because I disabled that Humanoid state. Your Thread is suspended, and I'm calling coroutine.close() on you. No need to defer THIS task. The Garbage Collector'll need several cycles to clean YOU away. Calling GetFriendsOnline() on you always returns an empty array. I'll set your HeadLocked and max out your NearPlaneZ.

###### is better than ####, and I can point out multiple reasons on why my statement is a solid fact. Firstly, ###### allows for people to escape the boundaries of normal ####, as they are not bound by any physical, psychological, or plain impossible limitations that normal #### has due to being filmed in the real world. ######, on the other hand, is not bound by anything, as it is either drawn or animated. This allows for the absolute creativity for ###### artists to be able to have when crafting their works in order to pleasure another person. Secondly, ###### is able to have better stories. In normal ####, you have all the same types of stories, such as ######. And, most #### actors are just plain shitty. ###### (more notably #########) is able to surpass this through the fact that there is no need for acting from anybody for them, meaning that the scenes in them are perfect and immersive. Thirdly, ###### requires mental gymnastics. In ####, you’re imagining in the third dimension, which is too weak as we are already living in the third dimension. In ######, you are thinking in the second, making it harder to put yourself in one of the characters shoes, and thereby requiring more mental strength in order to get off to. And, finally, ###### is art. All #### is is just a bunch of fake ass acting with some random guy holding a camera to film them. ###### artists, on the other hand, require years and years to get good at art, and each single frame (or panel, depending on whether it is animated or not) is hand drawn, which involves way more effort to do than simply filming people in the act. Due to all of these points, with ###### not being bound by real life limitations, having better, more creative stories, requiring mental gymnastics to get off to, and requiring more effort and literally being art, I can now conclude that ###### is better than ####.

Did you know that in terms of male human and female human breeding, you are the least compatible human. Your sheer lack of bitches and experience makes you the least likely pick for a sexual partner by anyone of the opposite gender. Plus, years of masturbation and porn make your sexual expectations far beyond the norm and cause you to ejaculate prematurely. Your expectations from porn mean that you will not feel that the sex was good, this plus the premature ejaculation, plus your measly 1.5 inches mean that no-one involved will end up satisfied at the end
